Raw QCEW data was downloaded from the Bureau of Labor Statistic's website (https://www.bls.gov/cew/downloadable-data-files.htm). In order to generate this structure several data manipulation operations were done on the raw QCEW data. Most notably, the QCEW is originally structured at the FIPS/NAICS/Ownership level, with \u201cOwnership\u201d referring to the governmental ownership status of the associated establishments(e.g. private, federal government, local government, etc). In order to reduce the dataset to the FIPS/NAICS level, the raw location quotients were combined using weighted averages based on establishment count. In addition, county/NAICS combinations that did not pass BLS\u2019 disclosure standards are not included and state level statistics for each industry are not included.",
