HERD is the primary source of information on R&D expenditures at U.S. colleges and universities. The survey is an annual census of institutions that expended at least $150,000 in separately accounted for R&D in the fiscal year. In addition to R&D expenditures, this provides data on institutional characteristics (i.e., highest degree granted, historically black college or university [HBCU], high Hispanic enrollment [HHE], public or private control).",
