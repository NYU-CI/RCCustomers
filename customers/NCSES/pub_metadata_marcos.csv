"""Gender differences between faculty members in higher education: A literature review of selected higher education journals"",","""dataset-428""","""Abstract Gender issues in higher educational institutions have attracted increasing levels of attention from researchers in recent decades. As a result, many studies have called for greater gender equity between men and women in universities. However, there is a lack of sufficient literature review studies that investigate gender differences between faculty members of universities. This paper offers a review of the literature on gender differences between faculty members in higher education during the period from 2000 to 2013. The objectives of the review are to: identify and explore patterns and trends in publication outlets; collect, document, scrutinise and critically analyse the current literature on this field; to identify gaps in the literature; and make recommendations for further research in this field. To accomplish this task, we collected the data from fourteen specialist academic journals that focus on higher education."",",semantic scholar,"Mamen Gomez Cama, Manuel Larron Jorge",semantic scholar,10.1016/j.edurev.2016.03.001,semantic scholar,Educational Research Review,Unpaywall,
"""An empirical study of scientific production: A cross country analysis, 1981-2002""","""dataset-428""","""This paper presents the results of an econometric approach to examine the determinants of scientific production at cross-country level. The paper aims not to provide accurate and robust estimates of investment elasticities (a doubtful task given the poor quality of the data sources and the modelling problems), but to develop and critically assess the validity of an empirical approach for characterising the production of science and its impact, from a comparative perspective. We employ and discuss the limitations of a production function approach to relate investment inputs to scientific outputs using a sample of 14 countries for which we have information on higher education research and development (HERD). The outputs are taken from the Thomson ISI\u00c2\u00ae national science indicators (2002) database on published papers and citations. The inputs and outputs for this sample of countries have been recorded for a period of 21\u00c2 years (1981-2002). A thorough discussion of the data shortcomings is provided. On the basis of this panel dataset we investigate the profile of the time lag between investment in HERD and research output and returns to national investment in science. We devote particular attention to analysing the presence of cross-country spillovers. We show their relevance and underline the international effect of the US system.""",semantic scholar,"Gustavo Atilio Crespi, Aldo Geuna, ",semantic scholar,10.1007/s11192-015-1632-4,semantic scholar,Research Policy,Unpaywall,
"""Science Funding and Short-Term Economic Activity""","""dataset-428""","""There is considerable interest among policy-makers in documenting short-term effects of science funding. A multiyear scientific journey that leads to long-term fruits of research, such as a moon landing, is more tangible if there is visible nearer-term activity, such as the presence of astronauts. Yet systematic data on such activities have not heretofore existed. The only source of information for describing the production of most science is surveys that have been called \u201ca rough estimate, frequently based on unexamined assumptions that originated years earlier\u201d (1).""",semantic scholar,"Bruce A.

"""Control of MSSA and MRSA in the United States: protocols, policies, risk adjustment and excuses""","""dataset-428""","""Data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 5, 2019 showed that Staph aureus infections are a major problem in the United States, with 119,000 infections and almost 20,000 deaths in 2017. Rates of decline for hospital-onset MRSA have slowed since 2012 and the United States is not on track for meeting the 2015\u2009U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services\u2019 goal of a 50% reduction by 2020. There is a need for improved standards for control of dangerous pathogens. Currently, the World Health Organization\u2019s\u00a0recommendation of preoperatively screening patients for Staph aureus\u00a0has not become a standard of care in the United States.The U.S. Veterans Health Administration also released data which found a much larger decrease in hospital-onset MRSA infections as opposed to hospital-onset MSSA using various infectious disease bundles that all included universal MRSA surveillance and isolation for MRSA carriers. These results mirror the results obtained by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service. These findings support the contention that the marked decline in hospital-onset MRSA infections observed in these studies is due to interventions which are specifically targeted towards MRSA.A case is made that concerns with the integrity of healthcare policy research, along with industrial conflicts-of-interest\u00a0have inhibited effective formulation of infectious disease policy in the United States. Because MRSA has become endemic in the general U.S. population (approximately 2%), the author advocates that universal facility-wide screening of MRSA on admission be included in infection prevention bundles used at U.S. hospital.""",semantic scholar,Kevin T.

"""Federal Funding For Research On The Leading Causes Of Death Among Children And Adolescents""","""dataset-428""","""Firearm injuries are the second-leading cause of death for US children and adolescents (ages\u00a01-18). This analysis quantified the federal dollars granted to research for the leading US causes of death for this age group in 2008-17. Several federal data sources were queried. On average, in the study period, $88\u00a0million per year was granted to research motor vehicle crashes, the leading cause of death in this age group. Cancer, the third-leading cause of mortality, received $335\u00a0million per year. In contrast, $12\u00a0million-only thirty-two grants, averaging $597 in research dollars per death-went to firearm injury prevention research among children and adolescents. According to a regression analysis, funding for pediatric firearm injury prevention was only 3.3\u00a0percent of what would be predicted by mortality burden, and that level of funding resulted in fewer scientific articles than predicted. A thirtyfold increase in firearm injury research funding focused on this age group, or at least $37\u00a0million per year, is needed for research funding to be commensurate with the mortality burden.""",semantic scholar,"Rebecca M.
