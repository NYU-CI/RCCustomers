"""Gender differences between faculty members in higher education: A literature review of selected higher education journals"",","""dataset-428""","""Abstract Gender issues in higher educational institutions have attracted increasing levels of attention from researchers in recent decades. As a result, many studies have called for greater gender equity between men and women in universities. However, there is a lack of sufficient literature review studies that investigate gender differences between faculty members of universities. This paper offers a review of the literature on gender differences between faculty members in higher education during the period from 2000 to 2013. The objectives of the review are to: identify and explore patterns and trends in publication outlets; collect, document, scrutinise and critically analyse the current literature on this field; to identify gaps in the literature; and make recommendations for further research in this field. To accomplish this task, we collected the data from fourteen specialist academic journals that focus on higher education."",",semantic scholar,"Mamen Gomez Cama, Manuel Larron Jorge",semantic scholar,10.1016/j.edurev.2016.03.001,semantic scholar,Educational Research Review,Unpaywall,
