"New linked data on research investments: Scientific workforce, productivity, and public value",dataset-370,"Longitudinal micro-data derived from transaction level information about wage and vendor payments made by federal grants on multiple U.S. campuses are being developed in a partnership involving researchers, university administrators, representatives of federal agencies, and others. This paper describes the UMETRICS data initiative that has been implemented under the auspices of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. The resulting data set reflects an emerging conceptual framework for analyzing the process, products, and impact of research. It grows from and engages the work of a diverse and vibrant community. This paper situates the UMETRICS effort in the context of research evaluation and ongoing data infrastructure efforts in order to highlight its novel and valuable features. Refocusing data construction in this field around individuals, networks, and teams offers dramatic possibilities for data linkage, the evaluation of research investments, and the development of rigorous conceptual and empirical models. Two preliminary analyses of the scientific workforce and network approaches to characterizing scientific teams ground a discussion of future directions and a call for increased community engagement.","Julia Helen Lane,Jason Owen-Smith,Rebecca Rosen,Bruce D.

Does Globalization of the Scientific/Engineering Workforce Threaten U.S. Economic Leadership?,dataset-370,"This paper develops four propositions that show that changes in the global job market for science and engineering (S&E) workers are eroding U.S. dominance in S&E, which diminishes comparative advantage in high tech production and creates problems for American industry and workers: 1. The U.S. share of the world's science and engineering graduates is declining rapidly as European and Asian universities, particularly from China, have increased S&E degrees while U.S. degree production has stagnated. 2. The job market has worsened for young workers in S&E fields relative to many other high-level occupations, which discourages U.S. students from going on in S&E, but which still has sufficient rewards to attract large immigrant flows, particularly from developing countries. 3. Populous low income countries such as China and India can compete with the U.S. in high tech by having many S&E specialists although those workers are a small proportion of their work forces. This threatens to undo the ""North-South"" pattern of trade in which advanced countries dominate high tech while developing countries specialize in less skilled manufacturing. 4. Diminished comparative advantage in high-tech will create a long period of adjustment for U.S. workers, of which the offshoring of IT jobs to India, growth of high-tech production in China, and multinational R&D facilities in developing countries, are harbingers. To ease the adjustment to a less dominant position in science and engineering, the U.S. will have to develop new labor market and R&D policies that build on existing strengths and develop new ways of benefiting from scientific and technological advances in other countries.",Richard B.

Immigration in High-Skill Labor Markets: The Impact of Foreign Students on the Earnings of Doctorates,dataset-370,"The rapid growth in the number of foreign students enrolled in American universities has transformed the higher education system, particularly at the graduate level. Many of these newly minted doctorates remain in the United States after receiving their doctoral degrees, so that the foreign student influx can have a significant impact in the labor market for high-skill workers. Using data drawn from the Survey of Earned Doctorates and the Survey of Doctoral Recipients, the study shows that a foreign student influx into a particular doctoral field at a particular time had a significant and adverse effect on the earnings of doctorates in that field who graduated at roughly the same time. A 10 percent immigration-induced increase in the supply of doctorates lowers the wage of competing workers by about 3 to 4 percent. About half of this adverse wage effect can be attributed to the increased prevalence of low-pay postdoctoral appointments in fields that have softer labor market conditions because of large-scale immigration.",George J.

A conceptual framework for studying science research careers,dataset-370,"The emergence of open science and new data practices is changing the way research is done. Opportunities to access data through purpose built platforms and repositories, combined with emerging data and meta-data curation practices are expanding data availability in many fields. This paper presents a conceptual framework for studying scientific research careers, motivated by opportunities to link empirical datasets to construct new analyses that address remaining and emerging knowledge gaps. The research career conceptual framework (RCCF) emerges from a review of relevant theories and empirical findings regarding research careers. The paper reviews existing models and develops a typology of research careers. It also compiles a list of variables drawn from the literature on research careers. Two preliminary demonstrations of linking datasets to address empirical questions are outlined. The final discussion advocates an approach to emerging data opportunities that combines theories and models with empirical research questions as being superior to an approach that produces ad hoc explanations on the basis of 'data fishing' exercises.","Carolina Canibano,Richard Woolley,Eric J.

African Americans in Economics at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor Since the Kerner Commission Report of 1968,dataset-370,"The campus of the University of Michigan experienced student unrest of the 1960s surrounding the Vietnam war and demands for racial inclusion. How the university, particularly the Department of Economics, responded in the aftermath of the Kerner Commission Report is the focus of this article. Michigan is not unique in producing few Black PhD economists over its history, having graduated 15 Black PhD economists of the more than 1,100 who have graduated from the department to date. Supreme Court decisions and a state ballot initiative halted the progress that was being made by the University to improve student and faculty diversity. Despite this, Michigan is one of only a few economics departments at majority institutions to have been home to several Black economists simultaneously.

Rationality is Gendered,dataset-370,"Shared rationality is the common ground of scientific progress. However, some theorists have argued that this common ground may not be level, in that subtle assumptions embedded within lay views of rationality marginalize some would-be participants. Specifically, feminist philosophers have argued that rationality is associated with male rather than female discourse. This claim has frequently been dismissed as incoherent, but a straightforward interpretation is readily available: The concept reason is semantically associated with the concept male. We support this hypothesis in four studies (total N > 900), finding that at both the explicit and implicit level, reason is preferentially associated with male, feeling is preferentially associated with female, male faces prime unrelated judgments of reason/rationality, and gendered associations are related to interest in academic disciplines as well as estimates of the (mis)representation of women within those disciplines. Implications for gender stereotyping and the representation of women in different fields are discussed.","Olivia Pavco-Giaccia, Martha Fitch Little, Jason Stanley, Yarrow Dunham",10.1525/collabra.274,Collabra: Psychology,"gender roles, gender stereotyping, implicit cognition"
University and Department Influences on Scientists' Occupational Outcomes,dataset-370,"Over 50,000 Ph.D. degrees in Science and Engineering (S&E) are awarded annually by United States (U.S.) universities, but few studies have systematically considered how the various aspects of doctoral training can influence the occupational outcomes of S&E doctoral graduates. This inquiry draws from the National Science Foundation’s Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System to investigate how the characteristics of U.S. degree-granting departments and institutions are associated with doctoral graduates’ entrance into different career sectors (i.e., academia, industry, government). The conceptual framework is based on the Scientific and Technical Human Capital theory (Bozeman et al. in Int J Technol Manag 22(7–8):716–740, 2001) as well as Berger and Milem’s (Higher Education: Handbook of Theory and Research, Agathon Press, New York, 2000) model of college impact. We find that a number of university and department factors are associated with the career choice of S&E doctoral graduates after finishing their Ph.D including: (a) structural characteristics, such as geographic location and faculty composition, (b) organizational behaviors, such as those symbolizing a program’s relative emphasis on traditional academic work versus activities valued in industry, and (c) peer group characteristics such as a department’s proportion of female and minority Ph.D. students. These results will be particularly informative for policy makers, faculty and administrators in S&E programs, and prospective doctoral students.","Jeongeun Kim, Molly Ott, Lindsey Dippold",10.1007/s11162-019-09584-6,Research in Higher Education,"STEM Ph.D. students, Occupational outcomes, College impact, Scientific and Technical Human Capital"
"Exit, Voice, Loyalty: Using an Exit Phone Interview to Mitigate the Silent Departure Phenomenon",dataset-370,"Doctoral student attrition is often referred to as a silent epidemic whereby students tacitly withdraw without ever being given an exit interview or follow-up. While most studies focus on the departing students, few studies focus on the institution's implicit and explicit policies and practices that encourage silence. Drawing upon the  ""Exit, Voice, Loyalty"" framework, we examined how the pathways to student voice that institutions provide for departing students contribute to the silent departure phenomenon. We recommend that campus stakeholders, policymakers, and administrators solicit critical feedback from departing students and develop instruments to assess their own departure process, rather than relying on national assessments.","Wendy Y.

"Control of MSSA and MRSA in the United States: protocols, policies, risk adjustment and excuses",dataset-428,"Data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 5, 2019 showed that Staph aureus infections are a major problem in the United States, with 119,000 infections and almost 20,000 deaths in 2017. Rates of decline for hospital-onset MRSA have slowed since 2012 and the United States is not on track for meeting the 2015 U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services' goal of a 50% reduction by 2020. There is a need for improved standards for control of dangerous pathogens. Currently, the World Health Organization's recommendation of preoperatively screening patients for Staph aureus has not become a standard of care in the United States.The U.S. Veterans Health Administration also released data which found a much larger decrease in hospital-onset MRSA infections as opposed to hospital-onset MSSA using various infectious disease bundles that all included universal MRSA surveillance and isolation for MRSA carriers. These results mirror the results obtained by the United Kingdom's National Health Service. These findings support the contention that the marked decline in hospital-onset MRSA infections observed in these studies is due to interventions which are specifically targeted towards MRSA.A case is made that concerns with the integrity of healthcare policy research, along with industrial conflicts-of-interest have inhibited effective formulation of infectious disease policy in the United States. Because MRSA has become endemic in the general U.S. population (approximately 2%), the author advocates that universal facility-wide screening of MRSA on admission be included in infection prevention bundles used at U.S. hospital.",Kevin T.

Federal Funding For Research On The Leading Causes Of Death Among Children And Adolescents,dataset-428,"Firearm injuries are the second-leading cause of death for US children and adolescents (ages 1-18). This analysis quantified the federal dollars granted to research for the leading US causes of death for this age group in 2008-17. Several federal data sources were queried. On average, in the study period, $88 million per year was granted to research motor vehicle crashes, the leading cause of death in this age group. Cancer, the third-leading cause of mortality, received $335 million per year. In contrast, $12 million-only thirty-two grants, averaging $597 in research dollars per death-went to firearm injury prevention research among children and adolescents. According to a regression analysis, funding for pediatric firearm injury prevention was only 3.3 percent of what would be predicted by mortality burden, and that level of funding resulted in fewer scientific articles than predicted. A thirtyfold increase in firearm injury research funding focused on this age group, or at least $37 million per year, is needed for research funding to be commensurate with the mortality burden.","Rebecca M.

Training opportunities for noncommunicable diseases research in Latin America: A scoping review,dataset-428,"Objective
To identify gaps in postgraduate training and options for building capacity in noncommunicable disease (NCDs) research in Latin America.


Methods
This was a scoping review of postgraduate opportunities in NCDs at top universities in Latin America and of training grants awarded by international funding bodies. Three global university rankings were considered-the QS Ranking, the Shanghai Ranking, and the Times Ranking. Latin American universities appearing in at least two of these were selected. University websites were searched for current graduate programs in biostatistics, epidemiology, global health, health economics, and public health. Information was extracted, summarized, and evaluated to identify any programs focused on NCDs. In addition, seven international funding bodies' websites were searched for training grants.


Results
In all, 33 universities offering 72 postgraduate programs met the inclusion criteria. One of these programs was exclusively devoted to NCD, and 12 offered NCDs as a dissertation research topic. Only two training grants were awarded to a Latin American institution for NCD capacity building. There are few NCD research training programs in Latin America and only one program exclusively focused on NCDs.


Conclusion
There seem to be few NCD-specific research training programs in Latin America. Leveraging existing programs and expanding those with a focus on NCDs could help enhance NCD research capacity in the region. These initiatives should be supported by international funding agencies through more funding opportunities.","Jessica Hanae Zafra-Tanaka,Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco,Antonio Bernabe-Ortiz,Vilma Edit Irazola,Goodarz Danaei,J Jaime Miranda",10.26633/RPSP.2019.68,Revista Panamericana de Salud PÃºblica,None

Federal funding of doctoral recipients: What can be learned from linked data,dataset-428,"Abstract This technical note describes the results of a pilot approach to link administrative and survey data to better describe the richness and complexity of the research enterprise. In particular, we demonstrate how multiple funding channels can be studied by bringing together two disparate datasets: UMETRICS, which is based on university payroll and financial records, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), which is one of the most important US survey datasets about the doctoral workforce. We show how it is possible to link data on research funding and the doctorally qualified workforce to describe how many individuals are supported in different disciplines and by different agencies. We outline the potential for more work as the UMETRICS data expands to incorporate more linkages and more access is provided.","Wan-Ying Chang,Wei Cheng,Julia Lane,Bruce A.

A Review of Approaches Used to Increase Awareness of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) in the United States,dataset-428,"PrEP is an important and useful HIV prevention strategy, yet awareness remains low among at-risk populations in the United States and elsewhere in the world. As previous studies have shown PrEP awareness to be important to PrEP uptake, understanding approaches to increase PrEP awareness is imperative. The current systematic review provides an overview of published articles and on-going research on PrEP awareness. Using PRISMA guidelines, two published articles and seven on-going research studies were identified that use different approaches to increase PrEP awareness. Findings highlight the need for research to target other at-risk populations and geographic areas. Future research should consider the use of technology and network approaches to assess whether they lead to increased awareness, accurate knowledge, and uptake of PrEP, along with examining which messaging works best for specific targeted, at-risk population(s).ResumenPrEP es una estrategia importante y Ãºtil, sin embargo, la concientizaciÃ³n dentro de las poblaciones de riesgo en Estados Unidos y en el Mundo, son bajas.

The role of the microbiome in immunologic development and its implication for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy,dataset-428,"Our understanding of the microbiome and its role in immunity, cancer initiation, and cancer progression has evolved significantly over the past century. The ""germ theory of cancer"" was first proposed in the early 20th century, and shortly thereafter the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, and later Fusobacterium nucleatum, were implicated in the development of gastric and colorectal cancers, respectively. However, with the development of reliable mouse models and affordable sequencing technologies, the most fascinating aspect of the microbiome-cancer relationship, where microbes undermine cancer immune surveillance and indirectly promote oncogenesis, has only recently been described. In this review, we highlight the essential role of the microbiome in immune system development and maturation. We review how microbe-induced immune activation promotes oncogenesis, focusing particularly on pancreatic carcinogenesis, and show that modulation of the microbiome augments the anti-cancer immune response and enables successful immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer.","Vrishketan Sethi,Gerardo A Vitiello,Deepak Saxena,George Miller,Vikas Dudeja",10.1053/j.gastro.2018.12.045,Gastroenterology,"Cancer Immunity, Immunotherapy, Microbiome, Bacteria, Pancreatic Cancer"
The relation between research priorities and societal demands: The case of rice,dataset-428,"To what extent is scientific research related to societal needs? To answer this crucial question systematically we need to contrast indicators of research priorities with indicators of societal needs. We focus on rice research and technology between 1983 and 2012. We combine quantitative methods that allow investigation of the relation between 'revealed' research priorities and 'revealed' societal demands, measured respectively by research output (publications) and national accounts of rice use and farmers' and consumers' rice-related needs. We employ new bibliometric data, methods and indicators to identify countries' main rice research topics (priorities) from publications. For a panel of countries, we estimate the relation between revealed research priorities and revealed demands. We find that, across countries and time, societal demands explain a country's research trajectory to a limited extent. Some research priorities are nicely aligned to societal demands, confirming that science is partly related to societal needs. However, we find a relevant number of misalignments between the focus of rice research and revealed demands, crucially related to human consumption and nutrition. We discuss some implications for research policy.","Tommaso Ciarli, Ismael Rafols",10.1016/j.respol.2018.10.027,Research Policy,"Research priority, Agenda setting, Research trajectories, Societal needs, Scientometrics, Rice"

But to date we know little about whether, how, and to what extent universities are committed to fostering this type of research. This paper develops the first measure of university commitment to IDR, which relies on the organizational structuring of research activity into research centers and departments. We extend the previous literature by measuring, rather than assuming, the interdisciplinary nature of research units. Using a large amount of textual data from 157 research universities in the United States, and combining machine learning and confirmatory factor analysis techniques, we develop a continuous and composite measure that taps universities' structural commitment to IDR. We then examine the commitment exhibited by specific universities and how such commitment varies by university characteristics like size, resources, and region. Results show that the fraction of centers and departments that are interdisciplinary is critical to measuring a university's structural commitment to IDR and to developing specific research policies aimed at fostering IDR.","Erin Leahey, Sondra N.

Modeling research universities: Predicting probable futures of public vs. private and large vs. small research universities,dataset-428,"The future of the American academic research enterprise is considered. Data are presented that characterize the resources available for the 160 best-resourced research universities, a small subset of the 2,285 4-year, nonprofit, higher education institutions. A computational model of research universities was extended and used to simulate three strategic scenarios: status quo, steady decline in foreign graduate student enrollments, and downward tuition pressures from high-quality, online professional master's programs. Four specific universities are modeled: large public and private, and small public and private. The former are at the top of the 160 in terms of resources, while the latter are at the bottom of the 160. The model's projections suggest how universities might address these competitive forces. In some situations, it would be in the economic interests of these universities to restrict research activities to avoid the inherent subsidies these activities require. The computational projections portend the need for fundamental change of approaches to business for universities without large institutional resources.","Willian Bill Rouse, John V.

A comparison of two approaches for measuring interdisciplinary research output: The disciplinary diversity of authors vs the disciplinary diversity of the reference list,dataset-428,"Abstract This study investigates the convergence of two bibliometric approaches to the measurement of interdisciplinary research: one based on analyzing disciplinary diversity in the reference list of publications, the other based on the disciplinary diversity of authors of publications. In particular we measure the variety, balance, disparity and integrated diversity index of, respectively, single-author, multi-author single-field, and multi-author multi-field publications. We find that, in general, the diversity of the reference list grows with the number of fields reflected in a paper's authors' list and, to a lesser extent, with the number of authors being equal the number of fields. Further, we find that when fields belonging to different disciplines are reflected in the authors' list, the disparity in the reference list is higher than in the case of fields belonging to the same discipline. However, this general tendency varies across disciplines, and noticeable exceptions are found at individual paper level.","Giovanni Abramo, Ciriaco Andrea D'Angelo, Lin Zhang",10.1016/j.joi.2018.09.001,Journal of Informetrics,"Interdisciplinarity, Research collaboration, Co-authorship, Bibliometrics, Italy"

"Doctoral student funding portfolios across and within engineering, life sciences and physical sciences",dataset-428,"Purpose 
This paper aims to determine the extent to which graduate student funding portfolios vary across and within engineering, life sciences and physical sciences academic fields for degree recipients. ""Graduate student funding portfolios"" refers to the percentages of students funded by fellowships, research assistantships, teaching assistantships, personal means and other sources within an organizational unit. 
Design/methodology/approach 
Using data from the Survey of Earned Doctorates data set, the authors analyze doctoral students' self-reported primary mechanisms of funding across and within academic fields varying along the Biglan taxonomy. The authors used cluster analyses and logistic regression to investigate within-field variation in funding portfolios. 
Findings 
The authors show significant differences in doctoral student funding portfolios across dimensions of the Biglan taxonomy characterizing academic fields. Within those fields, the authors demonstrate considerable variation in funding; institutions cluster into different ""modes"" of funding portfolios that do not necessarily map onto institutional type or control variables. 
Originality/value 
Despite tremendous investment in graduate students, there has been little research that can help characterize at the program-level how graduate students are funded, either by internal or external mechanisms. As programs continue to feel the pressures of more limited resources coupled with increasing graduate enrollment demands, investigating graduate student funding at a macro level is becoming increasingly important so programs may better understand constraints and predict shifts in resource availability.","David B.

Classifying Institutions to Guide Mission-Relevant Performance Assessment,dataset-428,"The shift from a post-industrial to a knowledge economy has placed higher education at the center of attention among policy makers and the public at large. The increase in attention, along with the increasing diversity in the funding sources of higher education institutions (HEIs) has prompted calls for greater accountability. Efforts to assess the effectiveness of HEIs include a variety of accountability frameworks and review processes. These efforts produce competing pressures for both institutional differentiation and convergence: differentiation to efficiently accommodate broader participation and meet a wide array of societal needs; and convergence to compete for international prestige and recognition as demarcated by research university rankings.

Examining the Carnegie Classification Methodology for Research Universities,dataset-428,"University ranking is a popular yet controversial endeavor. Most rankings are based on both public data, such as student test scores and retention rates, and proprietary data, such as school reputation as perceived by high school counselors and academic peers. The weights applied to these characteristics to compute the rankings are often determined in a subjective fashion. Of significant importance in the academic field, the Carnegie Classification was developed by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. It has been updated approximately every 5 years since 1973, most recently in February 2016. Based on bivariate scores, Carnegie assigns one of three classes (R1/R2/R3) to doctorate-granting universities according to their level of research activity. The Carnegie methodology uses only publicly available data and determines weights via principal component analysis. In this article, we review Carnegie’s stated goals and the extent to which their methodology achieves those goals. In particular, we examine Carnegie’s separation of aggregate and per capita (per tenured/tenure-track faculty member) variables and its use of two separate principal component analyses on each; the resulting bivariate scores are very highly correlated. We propose and evaluate two alternatives and provide a graphical tool for evaluating and comparing the three scenarios.","Robert Kosar, David W.

Radiology Research Funding Current State and Future Opportunities,dataset-428,"Funding for research has become increasingly difficult to obtain in an environment of decreasing clinical revenue, increasing research costs, and growing competition for federal and nonfederal funding sources. This paper identifies critical requirements to build and sustain a successful radiology research program (eg, key personnel and leadership, research training and mentorship, infrastructure, institutional and departmental funding or support), reviews the current state of available funding for radiology (including federal, nonfederal, philanthropy, crowdfunding, and industry), and describes promising opportunities for future funding (eg, health services, comparative effectiveness, and patient-centered outcomes research). The funding climate, especially at the federal level, changes periodically, so it is important to have radiology-specific organizations such as the American College of Radiology and the Academy of Radiology Research serving as our key advocates. Key to obtaining any funding, no matter what the source, is a well-formulated grant proposal, so a review of opportunities specifically available to radiologists to develop and hone their grant-writing skills is provided. Effective and sustained funding for radiology research has the potential to cultivate young researchers, bolster quality research, and enhance health care. Those interested in pursuing research need to be aware of the ever-changing funding landscape, research priority areas, and the resources available to them to succeed. To succeed, radiology researchers need to think about diversification and flexibility in their interests, developing multidisciplinary and multi-institutional projects, and engaging a broader base of stakeholders that includes patients.","Alison L Chetlen,Andrew J.

"Team Size, Noisy Signals, and the Career Prospects of Academic Scientists",dataset-428,"Team production is increasingly common in bench science, because scientists specialize and then combine their skills in a team. We argue that team production makes it more difficult to identify the quality of a junior scientist, as her productivity cannot be perfectly distinguished from others in the team. We develop a model of promotions within academic science: funding organizations observe the output of academic teams, and decide how much funding to award to each scientist. An exogenous change in the size of teams implies noisier signals. In response, funding organizations rationally tilt more of the funding toward senior scientists. Junior scientists have reduced prospects of ever obtaining enough funding to run their own laboratory. Using data from academic science, we show that when the size of scientific teams increased, there is evidence of fewer promotions, more funding to senior scientists, and more mid-career exit. We apply the insights gained to thinking about teamwork and promotions in organizations.","Catherine de Fontenay, Kwanghui Lim, Nicholas Snashall-Woodhams, Suren Basov",10.2139/ssrn.3098510,SSRN Electronic Journal,"team size, promotions, scientists, careers, economic model"
Doctoral student experiences in biological sciences laboratory rotations,dataset-428,"Purpose

The purpose of this study is to explore the experience of selecting and engaging in biological sciences laboratory rotations from the perspective of doctoral students.

Design/methodology/approach

Within the socialization framework, this study uses a qualitative approach whereby 42 biological sciences students enrolled at highly selective US universities were interviewed in the first and second year of doctoral training about laboratory rotation experiences.

Findings

The study revealed how doctoral students used formal and informal information networks, explored research topics, struggled with funding concerns and learned about the social aspect of the laboratories in which they rotated. 

Originality/value  
 
While rotations are considered a signature pedagogy in the laboratory sciences, students' experiences within them are understudied. This study offers new knowledge about what doctoral students experience while rotating that can be used to inform and improve rotation processes for both students and universities.","Michelle A.

"The Scientific Research Output of U.S. Research Universities, 1980-2010: Continuing Dispersion, Increasing Concentration, or Stable Inequality?",dataset-428,"Extending and expanding Geiger and Feller's (1995) analysis of increasing dispersion in R&D expenditures during the 1980s, the paper analyzes publication and citation counts as well as R&D expenditures for 194 top producers using Web of Science data. We find high and stable levels of inequality in the 1990s and 2000s, combined with robust growth both in the system and on individual campuses, considerable opportunities for short-range mobility and very limited opportunities for long-range mobility. Initial investments in research, private control, and the capacity of wealthy institutions to attract productive faculty are associated with high levels of scientific output. New entrants to the system and those that leave the system are both clustered near the bottom of the hierarchy.","Steven Brint,Cynthia E.

Infrastructure investments and entrepreneurial dynamism in the U.S.,dataset-428,"Abstract Investments in physical infrastructure induce environmental changes that serve both an enabling and disabling function, potentially acting to simultaneously stimulate new business establishment and provoke exit by some incumbent establishments. The opening of a new establishment results in the creation of jobs that did not previously exist. Similarly, the closing of an establishment results in the permanent loss of jobs. I develop a theoretical model that depicts this external enabler/disabler process and test the model's predictions empirically tested using annual state-level data spanning the period 1993-2015. The results from dynamic panel system GMM estimation suggest that public and private infrastructure investments exert opposite effects on dynamism. Whereas private infrastructure investment is positively and significantly associated with the creation of businesses and jobs, public infrastructure investments are associated with the destruction of businesses and jobs. These results point to private infrastructure investment serving primarily an entrepreneurial enabler role and public infrastructure investment an entrepreneurial disabler role.",Daniel L.
