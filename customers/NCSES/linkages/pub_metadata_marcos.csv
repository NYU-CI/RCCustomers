"""Gender differences between faculty members in higher education: A literature review of selected higher education journals"",","""dataset-428""","""Abstract Gender issues in higher educational institutions have attracted increasing levels of attention from researchers in recent decades. As a result, many studies have called for greater gender equity between men and women in universities. However, there is a lack of sufficient literature review studies that investigate gender differences between faculty members of universities. This paper offers a review of the literature on gender differences between faculty members in higher education during the period from 2000 to 2013. The objectives of the review are to: identify and explore patterns and trends in publication outlets; collect, document, scrutinise and critically analyse the current literature on this field; to identify gaps in the literature; and make recommendations for further research in this field. To accomplish this task, we collected the data from fourteen specialist academic journals that focus on higher education."",",semantic scholar,"Mamen Gomez Cama, Manuel Larron Jorge, Francisco Javier Andrades Peña",semantic scholar,10.1016/j.edurev.2016.03.001,semantic scholar,Educational Research Review,Unpaywall,

The paper aims not to provide accurate and robust estimates of investment elasticities (a doubtful task given the poor quality of the data sources and the modelling problems), but to develop and critically assess the validity of an empirical approach for characterising the production of science and its impact, from a comparative perspective. We employ and discuss the limitations of a production function approach to relate investment inputs to scientific outputs using a sample of 14 countries for which we have information on higher education research and development (HERD). The outputs are taken from the Thomson ISI\u00c2\u00ae national science indicators (2002) database on published papers and citations. The inputs and outputs for this sample of countries have been recorded for a period of 21\u00c2 years (1981-2002). A thorough discussion of the data shortcomings is provided. On the basis of this panel dataset we investigate the profile of the time lag between investment in HERD and research output and returns to national investment in science.

The current systematic review provides an overview of published articles and on-going research on PrEP awareness. Using PRISMA guidelines, two published articles and seven on-going research studies were identified that use different approaches to increase PrEP awareness. Findings highlight the need for research to target other at-risk populations and geographic areas. Future research should consider the use of technology and network approaches to assess whether they lead to increased awareness, accurate knowledge, and uptake of PrEP, along with examining which messaging works best for specific targeted, at-risk population(s).ResumenPrEP es una estrategia importante y \u00fatil, sin embargo, la concientizaci\u00f3n dentro de las poblaciones de riesgo en Estados Unidos y en el Mundo, son bajas.

We find high and stable levels of inequality in the 1990s and 2000s, combined with robust growth both in the system and on individual campuses, considerable opportunities for short-range mobility and very limited opportunities for long-range mobility. Initial investments in research, private control, and the capacity of wealthy institutions to attract productive faculty are associated with high levels of scientific output. New entrants to the system and those that leave the system are both clustered near the bottom of the hierarchy.""",,"Steven Brint, Cynthia E. Carr",,10.1007/s11024-017-9330-4,,Minerva,,

"""Infrastructure investments and entrepreneurial dynamism in the U.S.""","""dataset-428""","""Abstract Investments in physical infrastructure induce environmental changes that serve both an enabling and disabling function, potentially acting to simultaneously stimulate new business establishment and provoke exit by some incumbent establishments. The opening of a new establishment results in the creation of jobs that did not previously exist. Similarly, the closing of an establishment results in the permanent loss of jobs. I develop a theoretical model that depicts this external enabler/disabler process and test the model's predictions empirically tested using annual state-level data spanning the period 1993\u20132015. The results from dynamic panel system GMM estimation suggest that public and private infrastructure investments exert opposite effects on dynamism. Whereas private infrastructure investment is positively and significantly associated with the creation of businesses and jobs, public infrastructure investments are associated with the destruction of businesses and jobs. These results point to private infrastructure investment serving primarily an entrepreneurial enabler role and public infrastructure investment an entrepreneurial disabler role.""",,Daniel L.

The author discusses why US corporations engage as corporate citizens in relationships with higher education institutions and gauges the ethical concerns that may arise from such relationships. As governments continue to cut funding, support from individuals and corporations becomes continually more important. This research contributes to the corporate citizenship literature by providing a broad, holistic discussion to understand the range of motives and ROI expectations of corporate engagement in the American society as evidenced by inter-organizational relationships with higher education. This book is useful to provide both researchers and practitioners in corporations and higher education with insights to better design and manage inter-organizational relationships.""",,Morgan R.

This educational mission has become more prominent in recent years with the passage of the current iteration of the GI Bill. More than 1.5 million military-affiliated individuals used some form of educational benefit to enroll in postsecondary education annually in 2014. Three key issues surfaced during the initial phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF): institutional policies allowing service members and family members access to, withdrawal from, and readmission into the educational environment without educational or financial repercussions; financial support mechanisms and strategies to fill initial education benefit funding gaps; and transition programs and supports for military service as well as civilian support communities for veterans whose terms of enlistment were satisfied. Over the past decade, education associations and veteran service organizations have developed an evidence-based body of knowledge and practice centered on educational issues related to military-connected student populations. As educators develop a comprehensive strategy for addressing educational challenge in future military conflicts, they would do well to focus on the lessons learned during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.""",,"Kathryn McMurtry Snead, Lesley McBain",,10.1007/978-3-319-68984-5_9,,A Battle Plan for Supporting Military Families,,

Since the programs' inception, assessments of the SBIR/STTR programs at several federal agencies have utilized surveys of former grantees as the primary source of data. Response rates have typically been low, making non-response bias a potential threat to the validity of some of these studies' results. Meanwhile, the availability of large publicly-available datasets continues to grow and methods of text mining and linking databases continue to improve. By linking NIGMS grant funding records, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office data, and business intelligence databases, we explored innovation, commercialization and survival for recipients of NIGMS SBIR/STTR funding. In doing so, we were able to more completely assess several key outcomes of the NIGMS SBIR/STTR program. Our evaluation demonstrated that the NIGMS program performed above baseline expectations along all dimensions, and comparably to other federal agency SBIR/STTR grant programs. In addition, we show that the use of extant data increasingly is a viable, less expensive, and more reliable approach to gathering data for evaluation studies.""",,"James Onken, Andrew C Miklos, Travis F Dorsey, Richard Aragon, Anna Maria Calcagno",,10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2019.101710,,Evaluation and Program Planning,,
"""Evaluation of the Implementation Research Institute: Trainees' Publications and Grant Productivity""","""dataset-427""","""With growth in the field of dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, there has been growth in capacity building, with many training opportunities. As such, it is important to continue to evaluate D&I research training programs. This paper reports the results of an evaluation of the Implementation Research Institute (IRI), a R25 funded by the National Institute of Mental Health with additional funding by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The fourth cohort also had a supplement from the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Using bibliometrics data, we report on a quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study assessing whether the rates of scholarly productivity in D&I science of IRI fellows (those who applied and were accepted to the training) were greater than those who applied but were not accepted to IRI. Our findings show that Selected Applicants' odds of publishing in implementation science were higher for earlier alumni, starting at 12% 1 year out and increasing to 94% for those who were 4 years out from starting training. Chances for Non-Selected Applicants remained relatively stable, starting at 47% at 1 year and going to 33% at 4 years since their application, a pattern that was stable even after controlling for demographic characteristics. These results support the hypothesis that IRI is increasing the D&I research productivity of those selected to the program, and that our fellows are advancing the field of D&I compared to those investigators not selected to our institute. Our finding also indicates the importance of a 2-year training.""",,"Ana A Baumann, Bobbi J Carothers, John Landsverk, Emily Kryzer, Gregory A. Aarons, Ross C. Brownson, Charles A. Glisson, Brian S.

"""The Law and Economics of Tort Liability for Human Rights Violations in Global Supply Chains""","""dataset-427""","""The human rights of foreign workers in global supply chains are routinely violated, yet the problem so far has largely evaded a legal solution. Economic analysis shows why domestic tort liability can partially address this problem. Many consumers in developed countries have a lower willingness-to-pay for products produced by global supply chains that systemically subject foreign workers to egregiously dangerous working conditions in gross violation of their human rights. This attribute of consumer demand provides a basis for subjecting the domestic chain leader to domestic tort liability for the bodily injuries suffered by these foreign workers, including those employed by independent suppliers. Chain leaders, like other product sellers, are obligated to warn about foreseeable safety risks that are not known by consumers and would be material to their decision about whether to purchase or use a product. The tort duty also requires sellers to instruct consumers about the ways in which the purchase or use of the product might foreseeably harm third parties. A domestic seller that is the chain leader of a global supply chain would breach this duty by not warning domestic consumers that the product is produced by foreign workers who are systemically subjected to working conditions that are so unsafe as to amount to a gross violation of their human rights. Because the purchase of the product foreseeably exposes foreign workers to this ongoing risk of physical harm, they are protected by the tort duty and can recover for its breach. Causation can be established by the logic of the breached tort duty. If consumers had been warned that the product is produced in such a systemically unsafe work environment, a substantial number of them would not have purchased it \u2013 they would instead have purchased the same product at the higher price necessary to protect the foreign workers from these ongoing safety violations.
