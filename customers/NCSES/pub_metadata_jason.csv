The role of the microbiome in immunologic development and its implication for pancreatic cancer immunotherapy,dataset-427,"Our understanding of the microbiome and its role in immunity, cancer initiation, and cancer progression has evolved significantly over the past century. The \""germ theory of cancer\"" was first proposed in the early 20th century, and shortly thereafter the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, and later Fusobacterium nucleatum, were implicated in the development of gastric and colorectal cancers, respectively. However, with the development of reliable mouse models and affordable sequencing technologies, the most fascinating aspect of the microbiome-cancer relationship, where microbes undermine cancer immune surveillance and indirectly promote oncogenesis, has only recently been described. In this review, we highlight the essential role of the microbiome in immune system development and maturation. We review how microbe-induced immune activation promotes oncogenesis, focusing particularly on pancreatic carcinogenesis, and show that modulation of the microbiome augments the anti-cancer immune response and enables successful immunotherapy against pancreatic cancer.","Vrishketan Sethi, Gerardo A Vitiello, Deepak Saxena, George Miller, Vikas Dudeja",10.1053/j.gastro.2018.12.045,Gastroenterology,
