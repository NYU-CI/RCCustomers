Are transitions to self-employment beneficial?,dataset-370,"Abstract Much research has been conducted studying entry into self-employment and the corresponding rewards and consequences of self-employment on earnings. The literature finds mixed results regarding whether workers enter self-employment to maximize their pecuniary or their non-pecuniary benefits. This paper suggests that whether workers are able to increase their pecuniary or non-pecuniary benefits in self-employment depends on their motivations for entering self-employment in the first place. This study uses longitudinal NSF SESTAT data on over 28,000 scientists and engineers to track employment changes and changes in work outcomes over time for the same individuals. The research examines changes in pecuniary and non-pecuniary work outcomes when wage workers transition to self-employment, compared to those who do not change employers, as well as to those who change employers but do not transition to self-employment. This allows a deeper look at the implications of different types of mobility on work outcomes. The findings show that in general those who transition to self-employment experience improvements in their non-pecuniary outcomes but not in their pecuniary outcomes, however the results do differ depending on the motivation for moving. Using job satisfaction as a proxy measure for non-pecuniary benefits, this paper finds that while those who enter self-employment from wage work do generally improve their job satisfaction, job satisfaction rises for all movers, not just for those who enter self-employment.",semantic scholar,Briana Sell Stenard,semantic scholar,10.1016/j.jbvi.2019.e00131,semantic scholar,Journal of Business Venturing Insights,Unpaywall,
Academic Entrepreneurship: The Bayh-Dole Act versus the ProfessoraTMs Privilege,dataset-370,"Is the Bayh-Dole intellectual property regime associated with more and better academic entrepreneurship than the Professor 2019s Privilege regime? The authors examine data on US PhDs in the natural sciences, engineering, and medical fields who became entrepreneurs in 1993 20132006 and compare this to similar data from Sweden. They find that, in both countries, those with an academic background have lower rates of entry into entrepreneurship than do those with a non-academic background. The relative rate of academics starting entrepreneurial firms is slightly lower in the United States than in Sweden. Moreover, the mean economic gains from becoming an entrepreneur are negative, both for PhDs originating in academia and for non-academic settings in both countries. Analysis indicates that selection into entrepreneurship occurs from the lower part of the ability distribution among academics. The results suggest that policies supporting entrepreneurial decisions by younger, tenure-track academics may be more effective...",semantic scholar,"Thomas stebro,Serguey Braguinsky,Pontus Braunerhjelm,Anders Brostrm",semantic scholar,10.1177/0019793918819809,semantic scholar,ILR Review,unpaywall,
Why foreign STEM PhDs are unlikely to work for US technology startups,dataset-370,"Visa policies to retain United States-trained STEM PhDs are of central importance to national innovation and economic competitiveness. There is also growing interest in \""startup\"" visas that stimulate entrepreneurial activity and job creation, particularly in technology sectors. However, there is little understanding of how visa policies might influence foreign PhDs' employment in technology startups. This study investigates differences between 2,324 foreign and US PhDs from US research universities using a longitudinal survey of individuals' preferences and characteristics during graduate school and their subsequent employment in a startup or established firm. Among PhDs whose first job is industrial research & development, 15.8% of US PhDs work in a startup compared with 6.8% of foreign PhDs. Foreign PhDs are as likely as US PhDs to apply to and receive offers for startup jobs, but conditional on receiving an offer, they are 56% less likely to work in a startup. This disparity is partially explained by differences in visa sponsorship between startups and established firms and not by foreign PhDs' preferences for established firm jobs, risk tolerance, or preference for higher pay. Foreign PhDs who first work in an established firm and subsequently receive a green card are more likely to move to a startup than another established firm, suggesting that permanent residency facilitates startup employment. These findings suggest that US visa policies may deter foreign PhDs from working in startups, thereby restricting startups' access to a large segment of the STEM PhD workforce and impairing startups' ability to contribute to innovation and economic growth.",semantic scholar,"Michael Roach,John David Skrentny",semantic scholar,10.1073/pnas.1820079116,"EuropePMC,Semantic Scholar",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,unpaywall,
"Investigating the US biomedical workforce: gender, field of training, and retention",dataset-370,"The biomedical research workforce plays a crucial role in fostering economic growth and improving public health through discoveries and innovations. This study fills a knowledge gap by providing a comprehensive portrait of this workforce and retention within it. A distinguishing feature is that we use an occupation-based definition which allows us to look ‘backward’ to field of training and assess the extent to which it has grown more interdisciplinary, and how this differs by gender. The analysis is conducted using restricted-use SESTAT data, the most comprehensive dataset on the scientific workforce in the USA, for the years 1993, 2003, and 2010. Among the findings, we identify differences in interdisciplinarity in training by gender, and these differences have widened. In the retention analysis, which focuses on the 7-year period, 2003–10, we find that retention is negatively and significantly associated with interdisciplinary training for women, but not for men.",semantic scholar,"Anne E.

Investigation of an equity ethic in engineering and computing doctoral students,dataset-370,"Background: Research shows that engineering and computing students who are marginalized by race and/or gender and experience social suffering often wish to challenge social inequities through their vocation, an attribute we refer to as an equity ethic. This study explores how doctoral engineering and computing students develop this attribute even when they do not directly experience social suffering. Purpose: We explored the relationship between (a) doctoral engineering and computing students' experiences with social suffering and their development of an equity ethic and (b) their equity ethic and career interests. Methods:We present a thematic analysis of the transcripts of in‐depth, semistructured interviews with 18 engineering and computing PhD students, coding for experiences with social suffering, degree of equity ethic, and their career interests. Results: Students with an equity ethic who aspired to reduce inequities within their disciplines personally experienced or witnessed social suffering within and outside academia. Students with “high potential” for developing this attribute who aspired to help others with their disciplines acknowledged social suffering. While both those with an equity ethic and those with high potential saw inequities as socially caused, those with an equity ethic reported more impactful experiences with social suffering, resulting in greater empathy and responsibility to respond. Several students described neither altruistic nor social justice concerns (students with low potential) and did not experience social suffering directly or indirectly. Those with an equity ethic or high potential often showed interest in academia. Conclusions: Most participants expressed concerns for helping others in their occupations. This result suggests a nascent equity ethic that could be cultivated through intentional programmatic efforts.",semantic scholar,"Dara E. Naphan Kingery,Monica Miles,Amanda J. Brockman,Rachel G.

The impact of the H-1B cap exemption on Ph.D. labor markets,dataset-370,"The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-First Century Act of 2000 (AC21) eliminated the H-1B cap for foreign employees of academic, nonprofit and government research organizations. This act potentially affects the job preferences of newly graduated foreign Ph.D. students. Choosing a career in an uncapped H-1B-qualified entity means circumventing the risk of facing the fiercely competitive H-1B application process and possibly avoiding potential losses due to a visa rejection. We use data from the census of Ph.D. graduates to examine the causal effect of this policy change on academic and industry labor markets in the USA. We find that as a result of this policy, Ph.D. graduates with temporary visas are 5 percentage points more likely to pursue a job in academia, and 3\u20134 percentage points less likely to choose a job in industry.

Simulation of the leaky pipeline: Gender diversity in U.S. K-graduate education,dataset-370,"What is the future trend of gender (dis)parity in the U.S. higher education and workforce populations? I take a systems approach to develop a dynamic simulation model of gender diversity in U.S. higher education.

I simulated a model and examined its fidelity in replicating the historical data of U.S. higher education from 1970 to 2014. I then simulated the model to forecast future gender composition trends at different levels of education over the next two decades. The model forecasts that women will be the majority of university degree holders in the United States by 2035 (i.e., female to male ratio of 1.7 for advanced degrees) with lower dropout rates.

Does scientist immigration harm US science? An examination of the knowledge spillover channel,dataset-370,"The recruitment of foreign-trained scientists enhances US science through an expanded workforce but could also cause harm by displacing better connected domestically-trained scientists, thereby reducing localized knowledge spillovers. We develop a model in which a sufficient condition for the absence of overall harm is that foreign-trained scientists generate at least the same level of localized spillovers as the domestically-trained scientists they displace. To test this condition, we conduct a hypothetical experiment in which each foreign-trained displaces an appropriately matched domestically-trained scientist. Overall, we do not find evidence that foreign-trained scientists harm US science by crowding out better-connected domestically-trained scientists, measured by citations by the US scientific community to their publications.",,"Ajay Prakash Agrawal,John McHale,Alexander Oettl",,10.1016/j.respol.2019.01.005,,Research Policy,,
The changing career trajectories of new parents in STEM,dataset-370,"The gender imbalance in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields has remained constant for decades and increases the farther up the STEM career pipeline one looks. Why does the underrepresentation of women endure? This study investigated the role of parenthood as a mechanism of gender-differentiated attrition from STEM employment. Using a nationally representative 8-year longitudinal sample of US STEM professionals, we examined the career trajectories of new parents after the birth or adoption of their first child. We found substantial attrition of new mothers: 43% of women leave full-time STEM employment after their first child. New mothers are more likely than new fathers to leave STEM, to switch to part-time work, and to exit the labor force. These gender differences hold irrespective of variation by discipline, race, and other demographic factors. However, parenthood is not just a \""mother's problem\""; 23% of new fathers also leave STEM after their first child. Suggesting the difficulty of combining STEM work with caregiving responsibilities generally, new parents are more likely to leave full-time STEM jobs than otherwise similar childless peers and even new parents who remain employed full time are more likely than their childless peers to exit STEM for work elsewhere. These results have implications for policymakers and STEM workforce scholars; whereas parenthood is an important mechanism of women's attrition, both women and men leave at surprisingly high rates after having children. Given that most people become parents during their working lives, STEM fields must do more to retain professionals with children.",,"Erin A.

National health innovation systems: Clustering the OECD countries by innovative output in healthcare using a multi indicator approach,dataset-370,"he importance of innovation in healthcare has increased within the last decades as challenges, like rising costs and an aging demographic, have to be solved. The degree of innovativeness in healthcare is strongly influenced by the National Health Innovation System, which as a sectoral innovation system encompasses a wide variety of actors and related knowledge. Despite the highly practical relevance of the topic, there are only a few studies that analyze innovation in healthcare on a national level. Thus, this study is a starting point and, building on the theoretical framework of national innovation systems, answers the following questions: \u201cCan countries be grouped by their innovation output in healthcare and do those groups differ in factors describing the healthcare system? Do countries with strong national innovation systems also have strong national health innovation systems and vice versa?\u201d We compare the healthcare innovation output of 30 OECD countries using a multi-indicator approach and categorize them into four distinct groups using cluster analysis. The cluster consisting of the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands and Switzerland shows the highest innovation output measured in knowledge production and knowledge commercialization. Surprisingly, these countries, with the exception of Switzerland, only rank in the medium group when considering the entire national innovation system.

Does employment during doctoral training reduce the PhD completion rate?,dataset-370,"This paper examines relations between doctoral students’ employment and graduation outcomes at a research-intensive university in Russia. Since most doctoral students lack financial support, they find employment and work full-time. This study addresses two questions: first, how the employment status is related to graduation outcomes (defending a thesis) and, second, how characteristics of student employment decrease the chances of defence of a thesis. The research is based on a longitudinal dataset of doctoral students that were enrolled in doctoral programmes between 2008 and 2017. The dataset combines survey data collected during the doctoral training and administrative data about the students’ graduation outcomes gathered in 2018. The results show that on-campus employment increases the chances to defend the thesis and off-campus employment is negatively associated with the completion.

We use restricted-access, individual-level Survey of Earned Doctorates data to determine both where and when PhD recipients received their BA, and truncation-correction methodology to account for PhD receipt after the data end. Across fields, we find that PhD production is positively related to the number of highly-ranked PhD programs an institution has, suggesting such departments may play a dual role in both producing PhDs as well as encouraging undergraduates to earn PhDs themselves. We also find that PhD production is negatively related to the total number of students and the share of total BAs that are received in the field, and is positively related to student test scores.",,"Todd R.

We model career outcomes as competing risks, and compute cumulative incidence functions to discern differences in tenure and promotion outcomes by gender and race. We find incidence rates vary significantly by academic discipline, and in many instances, show larger effects than gender and racial or ethnic differences. Our examination also indicates that in particular academic fields, females are more prone to leave without tenure, and less likely to be promoted to full professor. We also find that racial or ethnic minorities are less likely to be promoted to full professor in certain areas.

Why so? I examine the intellectual trajectory of the new economic sociology to highlight the role of academic familism, disciplinary spillover prestige, and gender for privileging the networks perspective, over other intellectual currents, in the early developments of the subfield. First, academic familism in a form of cross generational mentor-mentee relationships reinforced networks-based research among early champions of the new economic sociology, such as Harrison White and Mark Granovetter and their students. Second, the network perspective thrived on spillover prestige from natural sciences, which also embraced the study of networks, as well as from economics. Third, alignment with methodological and gender hierarchies in the discipline of sociology privileged the quantitative male-led network analyses over other approaches, such as cultural or inequality analysis. Providing an interpretation of the history of economic sociology, this article also reveals the mechanisms that stall gender integration within sociological subfields despite broader trends in feminization of our discipline.",,Nina Bandelj,,10.1007/s12108-019-09421-4,,The American Sociologist,,

National Institute of Health (NIH) funding patterns in Schools of Nursing: Who is funding nursing science research and who is conducting research at Schools of Nursing?,dataset-370,"Abstract Background Developing the next generation of nurse researchers must be a priority to advance the discipline's science. A comprehensive description of the current federally-funded research is useful for understanding the research enterprise in Schools of Nursing. Purpose To describe the past 5 years of National Institute of Health (NIH) funding patterns in US Schools of Nursing. Method Data were extracted from NIH RePORTER for years 2014, 2013, 2018. The total number of award types (F, K, R, U, P and T) granted to a School of Nursing in the US was summarized and organized by Institute. Grants were then characterized according to whether the Principal Investigator had a nursing degree (yes or no). Finally, the total funding from each NIH Institute/Center that was awarded to a School of Nursing was assessed. Findings Nearly 50% of the National Institute of Nursing Research's (NINR) extramural budget is awarded through grants to Schools of Nursing in the US. NINR funds 80% of training grants and >70% of Center grants, which support the education and infrastructure for research, respectively, at Schools of Nursing. Among top ranked research-intensive Schools of Nursing, awards to non-nurse Principal Investigators (PIs) averaged 34.5% across all years. The percentage of NIH funds awarded to non-nurse PIs ranged from 0% at 3 Schools to as high as 97% at 1 School of Nursing. Over the past 5 fyears, the following Institutes have consistently been the largest funders (total dollars) to Schools of Nursing: NINR, National Institute of Aging, National Institute of Minority and Health Disparities, National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

This paper focuses on the sources of financial support that can facilitate access to faculty careers. I use multinomial logistic estimation and predicted probabilities to examine relationships between various sources of financial support (e.g., assistantships) and Latina and Latino social scientists' post-graduation plans. Plots of predicted probabilities show that the relationships between sources of support and Latina and Latinos' post-graduation plans are similar among other racial and ethnic groups.",,Frank Fernandez,,10.1353/rhe.2019.0093,,The Review of Higher Education,,
The Trade-Offs of Teamwork Among STEM Doctoral Graduates,dataset-370,"Teamwork has increasingly become prevalent in professional fields such as academic science, perhaps partly because research shows that teams tend to produce superior work. Although research on teamwork has typically focused on its impact on work products, we complement that work by examining the degree to which teamwork influences salary, hours worked, and overall job satisfaction. Drawing on microdata collected through the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients as well as the Survey of Earned Doctorates, we find that doctoral degree holders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields tend to earn substantially higher salaries and work more hours when they engage in teamwork. We also find no comparable difference in overall job satisfaction as a function of whether individuals work within teams. Additionally, we find evidence that age interacts significantly with teamwork, whereby older teamworkers tend to earn relatively more when participating in teams without appearing to work more hours; and we show that employment sector is important, whereby teamwork is relevant for salaries and hours worked in education and industry but not in government. Although our study is based on market outcomes and behavioral measures, our findings provide grounds for future research that examines the psychological mechanisms that are relevant to understanding why people join teams as well as the psychological consequences that people encounter through teamwork. More generally, this study provides a model for considering individual-level antecedents and outcomes associated with teamwork when degrees of discretion exist with respect to teaming.

"Interdisciplinary Dissertation Research Among Public Health Doctoral Trainees, 2003-2015",dataset-370,"Given the call for more interdisciplinary research in public health, the objectives of this study were to (1) examine the correlates of interdisciplinary dissertation completion and (2) identify secondary fields most common among interdisciplinary public health graduates. METHODS: We analyzed pooled cross-sectional data from 11 2009 doctoral graduates in the Survey of Earned Doctorates, 2003-2015. The primary outcome was interdisciplinary dissertation completion. Covariates included primary public health field, sociodemographic characteristics, and institutional attributes. RESULTS: From 2003 to 2015, a total of 4005 of 2009 (36.0%) doctoral graduates in public health reported interdisciplinary dissertations, with significant increases observed in recent years. Compared with general public health graduates, graduates of environmental health (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74; P < .001) and health services administration (OR = 1.38; P < .001) doctoral programs were significantly more likely to report completing interdisciplinary dissertation work, whereas graduates from biostatistics (OR = 0.51; P < .001) and epidemiology (OR = 0.76; P < .001) were less likely to do so. Completing an interdisciplinary dissertation was associated with being male, a non-US citizen, a graduate of a private institution, and a graduate of an institution with high but not the highest level of research activity. Many secondary dissertation fields reported by interdisciplinary graduates included other public health fields. CONCLUSION: Although interdisciplinary dissertation research among doctoral graduates in public health has increased in recent years, such work is bounded in certain fields of public health and certain types of graduates and institutions. Academic administrators and other stakeholders may use these results to inform greater interdisciplinary activity during doctoral training and to evaluate current and future collaborations across departments or schools.",,"Elizabeth H.

Survey of checkpoints along the pathway to diverse biomedical research faculty,dataset-370,"There is a persistent shortage of underrepresented minority (URM) faculty who are involved in basic biomedical research at medical schools. We examined the entire training pathway of potential candidates to identify the points of greatest loss. Using a range of recent national data sources, including the National Science Foundation's Survey of Earned Doctorates and Survey of Doctoral Recipients, we analyzed the demographics of the population of interest, specifically those from URM backgrounds with an interest in biomedical sciences. We examined the URM population from high school graduates through undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training as well as the URM population in basic science tenure track faculty positions at medical schools. We find that URM and non-URM trainees are equally likely to transition into doctoral programs, to receive their doctoral degree, and to secure a postdoctoral position. However, the analysis reveals that the diversions from developing a faculty career are found primarily at two clearly identifiable places, specifically during undergraduate education and in transition from postdoctoral fellowship to tenure track faculty in the basic sciences at medical schools. We suggest focusing additional interventions on these two stages along the educational pathway.",,"Lindsay C Meyers,Abigail M Brown,Liane Moneta-Koehler,Roger Chalkley",,10.1371/journal.pone.0190606,,PLOS ONE,,"Demography,data sources,Biomedical Research,medical schools,Hearing Loss, High-Frequency,biological Science Disciplines,Doctorate Degree"

Profile of the graduate student population in U.S. medical schools.,dataset-370,"The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) sponsored surveys of accredited U.S. medical schools in 1994-95 and in 1995-96 to gather enough data to determine an accurate profile of the population of students enrolled in and/or graduated from biomedical PhD and MD-PhD programs at these institutions. Previously collected data on the graduate student population at medical schools often did not distinguish between PhD students at the medical school and graduate students in other parts of the university. The AAMC surveys defined a medical school PhD- or MD-PhD-trained student as one whose major professor holds his or her primary appointment in a department of the medical school. The data were the result of census-taking by the responding schools on October 1, 1994, and October 1, 1995. There were 81 responses to each of the two surveys. Overall, 104 medical schools supplied data in either one or both of the survey years. When the data are extrapolated from the sample to the total population of 122 medical schools that award graduate degrees, a number of interesting estimates emerge. (1) When compared with the 1995 data for 18 biomedically-related biological science disciplines from the National Research Council's Survey of Earned Doctorates, the AAMC survey indicates that approximately 60% of the 4,000 PhDs awarded were earned by students studying at U.S. medical schools. (2) The total enrollment of PhD students in U.S. medical schools is approximately 18,600, a number that is about 25-30% of the number of medical students currently enrolled at all accredited U.S. medical schools. In some institutions, the number of graduate students rivals the number of medical students. (3) PhD students are enrolled in a wide variety of programs bearing titles reflective of a trend toward \""interdisciplinary\"" rather than \""departmental\"" degrees. (4) At a given time, the number of students supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants is nearly twice that provided for by NIH traineeships. In addition, all forms of institutional support provide for more than one-third of the PhD students in U.S. medical schools. (5) Approximately 24% of enrolled students are international students on temporary or permanent visas. (6) The data obtained from the two surveys of graduate programs within medical schools are relatively consistent, enabling more confidence in the reliability and accuracy of findings presented in this report.",,"S W Ammons,Diane Kelly",,10.1097/00001888-199709000-00020,,Academic Medicine,,"United States National Institutes of Health,medical schools,schools,Association of American Medical Colleges,CensusesBiological Science Disciplines,Providing (action),funding grants"

Female computer science doctorates: what does the survey of earned doctorates reveal?,dataset-370,"Based on the National Center for Education Statistics (2000), in the 1997-1998 academic year 26.7% of earned bachelors' degrees, 29.0% of earned masters' degrees and 16.3% of earned doctorates' degrees in computer science were awarded to women. As these percentages suggest, women are underrepresented at all academic levels in computer science (Camp, 1997). The most severe shortage occurs at the top level---the doctorate in computer science. We know very little about the women who persist to the top level of academic achievement in computer science.This paper examines a subset of data collected through the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The specific focus of this paper is to identify trends that have emerged from the SED with respect to females completing doctorates in computer science between the academic years 1990-1991 and 1999-2000. Although computer science doctorates include doctorates in information science, prior research (Camp, 1997) suggests that the percentage of women completing doctorates in information science as compared to computer science is low. The specific research questions are:1. How does the percentage of women who complete doctorates in computer science compare to those that complete doctorates in other fields?2. How does the length of time in school and the sources of funding differ for females as compared to males who complete doctorates in computer science?3. Where do women go after completing doctorates in computer science and what positions do they acquire? How do these experiences differ from their male peers?",,Barbara Moskal,,10.1145/543812.543841,,ACM SIGCSE Bulletin,,"computer science,List of fields of doctoral studies in the United States,Information science,experience,"
Stability and Longevity in the Publication Careers of U.S. Doctorate Recipients,dataset-370,"Since the 1950s, the number of doctorate recipients has risen dramatically in the United States. In this paper, we investigate whether the longevity of doctorate recipients' publication careers has changed. This is achieved by matching 1951-2010 doctorate recipients with rare names in astrophysics, chemistry, economics, genetics and psychology in the dissertation database ProQuest to their publications in the publication database Web of Science. Our study shows that pre-PhD publication careers have changed: the median year of first publication has shifted from after the PhD to several years before PhD in most of the studied fields. In contrast, post-PhD publication career spans have not changed much in most fields. The share of doctorate recipients who have published for more than twenty years has remained stable over time; the shares of doctorate recipients publishing for shorter periods also remained almost unchanged. Thus, though there have been changes in pre-PhD publication careers, post-PhD career spans remained quite stable.",,"Cathelijn J. F. Waaijer,Benoit Macaluso,Cassidy R.

Size and characteristics of the biomedical research workforce associated with U.S. National Institutes of Health extramural grants,dataset-370,"The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) annually invests approximately $22 billion in biomedical research through its extramural grant programs. Since fiscal year (FY) 2010, all persons involved in research during the previous project year have been required to be listed on the annual grant progress report. These new data have enabled the production of the first-ever census of the NIH-funded extramural research workforce. Data were extracted from All Personnel Reports submitted for NIH grants funded in FY 2009, including position title, months of effort, academic degrees obtained, and personal identifiers. Data were de-duplicated to determine a unique person count. Person-years of effort (PYE) on NIH grants were computed. In FY 2009, NIH funded 50,885 grant projects, which created 313,049 full- and part-time positions spanning all job functions involved in biomedical research. These positions were staffed by 247,457 people at 2,604 institutions. These persons devoted 121,465 PYE to NIH grant-supported research. Research project grants each supported 6 full- or part-time positions, on average. Over 20% of positions were occupied by postdoctoral researchers and graduate and undergraduate students.

"Disparities in publication patterns by gender, race and ethnicity based on a survey of a random sample of authors",dataset-370,"Gender and racial disparities have greatly diminished in academia over the last 30 years, but attrition rates among women and minority faculty still remain high. In this paper we examine gender and racial disparities in publishing, an activity that is important for career advancement, but has not been incorporated adequately into the debate on faculty attrition. We surveyed a random sample of 1,065 authors who contributed a peer-reviewed journal article indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) in 2005 and at least one other article during the period of 2001 to 2004 in four academic disciplines representing natural sciences (biochemistry and water resources) and social sciences (anthropology and economics). We then report on the relationships between demographic variables (gender and race/ethnicity) and career-related variables (academic rank, discipline, and h-index) of these authors. Our findings show that at every career level and within each discipline, women were under-represented in academic positions compared to men and an even lower percentage of women published at each academic level than were employed at that level. Further, we found that women had lower h-indices than men in all four disciplines surveyed. Societal and biological constraints may reduce women's ability to obtain research intensive positions and contribute to these gender disparities. Hispanics and blacks were underrepresented among individuals awarded with doctoral degrees, doctorate recipients employed in academia, and academics publishing in WoS as compared to their representation in the population. Whites, Asians, and Native Americans and Pacific Islanders were adequately or over-represented in each category. Additionally, blacks had lower h-indices than the other ethnic groups across the disciplines surveyed. Compared to women, attrition among blacks and Hispanics appears to occur earlier in their career development. Cumulative experiences with discrimination and stereotypes may partly explain higher attrition and lower publication productivity among blacks and Hispanics.",,"Allison L. Hopkins,James W.

"Employment Trends Among Public Health Doctoral Recipients, 2003-2015",dataset-370,"Objectives. To examine postgraduation employment trends among graduates of doctoral programs in public health from 2003 to 2015.
Methods. We analyzed pooled cross-sectional data from a census of graduates receiving a research doctorate from US accredited institutions. The outcome of interest was employment status. Covariates included public health discipline, sociodemographic characteristics, and institutional attributes.
Results. Of 11 771 graduates, nearly two thirds secured employment in either academic (34.8%) or nonacademic (31.4%) settings at the time of graduation. The proportion of those still seeking employment increased over time. Individuals who were White, younger, trained in either biostatistics or epidemiology, or from an institution with the highest level of research intensity were significantly more likely to secure employment. Academic employment was the most common setting for all 5 public health disciplines, but we observed differences in employment patterns (e.g., government, nonprofit, for-profit) across disciplines.
Conclusions. Certain characteristics among public health doctoral recipients are correlated with postgraduation employment. More research is needed, but the observed increase in individuals still seeking employment may be attributable to increases in general public health graduates from for-profit institutions.",,"Brittany L.

"Are Race, Ethnicity, and Medical School Affiliation Associated With NIH R01 Type Award Probability for Physician Investigators?",dataset-370,"PURPOSE: o analyze the relationship among National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 Type 1 applicant degree, institution type, and race/ethnicity, and application award probability. METHOD: the authors used 2000-2006 data from the NIH IMPAC II grants database and other sources to determine which individual and institutional characteristics of applicants may affect the probability of applications being awarded funding. They used descriptive statistics and probit models to estimate correlations between race/ethnicity, degree (MD or PhD), and institution type (medical school or other institution), and application award probability, controlling for a large set of observable characteristics. RESULTS: Applications from medical schools were significantly more likely than those from other institutions to receive funding, as were applications from MDs versus PhDs. Overall, applications from blacks and Asians were less likely than those from whites to be awarded funding; however, among applications from MDs at medical schools, there was no difference in funding probability between whites and Asians, and the difference between blacks and whites decreased to 7.8%. The inclusion of human subjects significantly decreased the likelihood of receiving funding. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with applications from whites, applications from blacks have a lower probability of being awarded R01 Type 1 funding, regardless of the investigator's degree. However, funding probability is increased for applications with MD investigators and for those from medical schools. To some degree, these advantages combine so that applications from black MDs at medical schools have the smallest difference in funding probability compared with those from whites.",,"Donna K Ginther,Laurel L.
